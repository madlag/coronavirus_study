    "# Comparison of the Coronavirus outbreak among countries\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunday, March 08, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to check what is the oubreak evolution in each country, and to some extent to forecast what may be the next steps: some countries were exposed after some others, and **we have the opportunity to see the path they followed and to compare it to the countries that are now exposed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is using **ECDC data** (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu). Unfortunately the data is **lagging roughly 2 days**, so you may have to add your own data points if you want to have realtime graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "China, and now Italy are providing statistics that can be used for this purpose.\n",
    "This notebook shows that France is roughly following the same path 9 days later, and the USA too.\n",
    "**We are using the number of deaths to study the outbreak, as those numbers may prove more precise than the case numbers, which are subject to different policies among countries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can note is that the **initial natural trend is doubling of the deaths every 2 days**. This is very fast, as some pandemics show that this doubling is usually observed every 6 days.\n",
    "**China deaths curve show a large slowing down of the outbreak after this initial phase, that may related to a very strong policy to contain it.**\n",
    "**Italy shows no slowdown since the beginning**, we are still in this early phase. The next days will show if the curve follows China curve, or if the exponential growth will go on for more days, especially that a full lockdown has been declared in the country.\n",
    "It's probably too early for France and USA to conclude, but the trend is very similar right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Following graphs are using logarithmic scale, because that's the right thing to do when processing data about an exponential process. That should not hide the fact that the growth is much more severe that what those graphs seems to convey.**\n",
